# Bike_sharing

## Overview
In this project we are going to use data from a Bike sharing company located in NYC to try to convinced a group of investors about the implementation of the same business model in Des Moines, Iowa. Resources: Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau and Database from August 2019 Citibike in NYC.

## Results

1) Most of the trips last less than one-hour.

## Summary

We can see that the bikes are being used as a trasportation to and from work. They are also used during weekends for recreation. The subscribers are actually using the service, so we need to convince people to subscribe. Males are the ones that used more the bike, so our marketing needs to be focused on them but we need to offer something that makes women more interested in using the bikes, maybe changing the style of the bikes.

We need to check our age demographics for advertisement. We can see that people born in the late 60's and in the 90's are our target market.

We need to know women hours usage to try to do something to increase it.
